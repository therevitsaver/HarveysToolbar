Free end user licence agreement: drafting notes
This document is a free-to-use software EULA or end user licence. Click-wrap and web-wrap licences can be created using this document, as well as more traditional shrink-wrap licences. The document governs the legal relationship between a licensor and its customers.  Note: although this EULA can be used for B2C licences as well as B2B licences, it does not include a distance selling clause. See our software download T&Cs for a document incorporating such a clause.  There are a range of optional provisions in the EULA. These cover such matters as: a contractual right to a return/refund; the provision of support in relation to the software; and the supply and application of updates to the software.
Section: Preamble to end user licence agreement
This wording may be used for "shrink-wrap" software agreements - that is, agreements that are visible through product packaging and are formally accepted when a person unseals the software packaging. There may be a right to return software, because a customer may not have a chance to review the agreement terms before purchasing the software.
•	Should the User return the software if the terms of this document are not accepted?
•	Within what period must the software be returned?
•	Will there be a right to return the software for a refund?
This wording may be used for "click-wrap" software agreements - that is, agreements that are formally accepted as part of the software installation process. There is an optional right to return the software, which should be included where customers will or may not have a chance to review the agreement terms before purchasing the software.
•	Will customers have a right to return the software if they do not accept this document?
•	How should the software be returned?
•	Will the customer be entitled to a refund upon the return of the software under this provision?
This wording may be used for "web-wrap" agreements - that is, agreements that are formally accepted on a website before the software is downloaded. Accordingly, there is no right to return the software.
Optional element.
•	What third parties may use the software on behalf of, or under the authorisation of, the licensee?
•	Identify relevant persons.

Clause 14: Limitations and exclusions of liability
Contractual limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated and controlled by law, and the courts may rule that particular limitations and exclusions of liability in contracts are unenforceable.    Exclusions and limitations of liability in UK B2B contracts are primarily regulated by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 ("UCTA"), while those in UK B2C contracts are primarily regulated by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 ("CRA").    Contracts regulated by UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 2(1), UCTA). Except insofar as the relevant term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such contracts cannot exclude or restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of an express or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for misrepresentation (Section 3, Misrepresentation Act 1967). In addition, if a contract is regulated by UCTA, and one of the parties is dealing on the other's written standard terms of business, then except insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict his liability in respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him; or (iii) claim to be entitled, in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no contractual performance at all (see Section 3, UCTA). UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly in the case of contracts for the sale of goods and contracts under which possession or ownership of goods passes.    Consumer contracts regulated by the CRA cannot exclude or restrict liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 65(1), CRA). Further, any "unfair term" in such a contract will not be binding on the consumer (Section 62(1), CRA). A contractual term is unfair "if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer" (Section 62(3), CRA).    Section 57 of the CRA provides (inter alia) that a term in a services contract will not bind consumers if it excludes any liability of the trader to provide the services with reasonable care and skill.    A "grey list" of provisions that may be regarded as unfair is set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the CRA. Some of these have implications for the drafting of limitations and exclusions of liability. For example, they include: "[a] term which has the object or effect of excluding or limiting the trader's liability in the event of the death of or personal injury to the consumer resulting from an act or omission of the trader."    "Where a term of a consumer contract, or a consumer notice, purports to exclude or restrict a trader's liability for negligence, a person is not to be taken to have voluntarily accepted any risk merely because the person agreed to or knew about the term or notice" (Section 65(2), CRA).    The courts are particularly likely to intervene where a party is seeking to rely on a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard terms and conditions, but will also sometimes intervene where a term has been individually negotiated.    The courts may be more likely to rule that provisions excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting liability, are unenforceable.  If there is a risk that any particular limitation or exclusion of liability will be found to be unenforceable by the courts, that provision should usually be drafted as an independent term, and be numbered separately from the other provisions.    These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of liability.

Optional element.
Clause 14.7
Optional element.

•	Will or might a party to the document be an individual, rather than a corporate entity?
Clause 15.5
Optional element.
•	What notice period applies in the case of termination for non-payment?
Clause 16: Effects of termination

•	Which law will govern the document?
Clause 17.9
Optional element.
As a practical matter, it makes sense for the courts with expertise in the relevant law to have the right to adjudicate disputes. Where one of the parties is outside England (or at least the UK), you may want to grant the courts of their home jurisdiction the right to adjudicate disputes, as this could ease enforcement in some circumstances.
•	The courts of which jurisdiction will have the exclusive right to adjudicate disputes relating to the document (subject to applicable law)?

This provision is designed to exclude the application of a rule of interpretation known as the ejusdem generis rule. That rule may affect the interpretation of contractual clauses that list particular examples or instances of some more general idea, by limiting the scope of the general idea by reference to those particular examples or instances.
